# Chess Board Generator - Refactored
### Random generation using 75% of all chess pieces with some rules applied.

Creating more object-oriented version of the project.
You can find the initial version [here](https://github.com/Ribel78/CPPCourseEGT_ChessBoardGenerator)

## **Project Summary**

- Random chess board generation
- Chess pieces must be 75% (24 pieces). No illegal positions allowed. No checks.
- Buttons to Start/Stop the chess board generation/simulation.
- Display of time statistics for the board generation part of the code.
- Click on FEN notation (bottom text) to copy it in clipboard and open a website to explore the chess board further
- Simulator Mode - start/stop simulation, save board descriptions to file, highlight legal moves of selected piece, review last 20 simulations.
- Viewer Mode - read board descriptions from file using UP/DOWN arrow keys,  highlight legal moves of selected piece.

  ## **Refactoring update - 04.04.2024**
  **New look and functionalities**. Option to change the number of simulated pieces and writing/reading the simulated chess boards to file.
